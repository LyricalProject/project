# Advanced Database Management Systems course project

## DESCRIPTION 

#### • Define and describe the project goal and its applications as well as its benefits in the real-world. Describe the problem and its solution that you propose.


Many problems have occurred from COVID-19. Medicines are not enough, infirmaries lack space, people have no choice but to get treated at home. We noticed that people started to share medicines for people in need, share information about the availability of certain medicines in pharmacies. We decided to create a service for citizens of Kazakhstan where all information about medicines in nearby pharmacies of people in need will be stored in one website. People who is willing to share or sell their medicine can post about it and find each other.


#### • Define the scope of the project. Define the project scope that your team can finish the proposed goals (and project functions/features) within CSS348 class. Unfinished projects will be graded with low score.



Our goal is to create a web-service that is simple to use. Our website will contain functions:
    1. Registration
    2. Search for medicine and pharmacy in specified region
    3. Post medicines for sale or for free
    4. Adding pharmacies to the database
    5. To keep a medical record of users’ diagnoses
    
    
    
#### • Choose a type of the user-interface (web, desktop, mobile, etc.). You have complete freedom in choosing the type of the user-interface. Note, make sure you can connect the interface with the database of your choice. For example, using JDBC drivers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDBC_driver). Describe your decisions in the project description.



We decided to choose web, because it’s easier to access that way and we’ve learned thoroughly web programming in previous year, and never studied mobile programming. 


#### • Choose a programming language and database server. Explain your decisions in the project description.


Programming languages: PHP, PL/SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript;
Database server: Oracle;

We chose PHP because we are comfortable with it. PL/SQL is easier to use for us and it calls ready-made functions. When it comes to Oracle as database server, we studied database for 2 years on oracle servers so it will be better to keep working with it. And HTML, CSS, JavaScript for obvious reasons.
